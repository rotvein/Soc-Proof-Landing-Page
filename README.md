# Responsive landing page layout
## Enjoy it deployed
https://rotvein.github.io/Soc-Proof-Landing-Page
## Description
### Technologies used
It is a responive layout made with `html`, `css`, `scss` and bundled with `webpack`. 

To make the layout responsive I've used `grid`'s, `flex`'s, `@media` queries.
### Customization
To make it adjustable I have all the custom variables that define colors, font-size and font-weight collected in the `_variables.scss` partial.

I have used utility classes collected in the `_utilityClasses.scss` partial to make it even more customizable.
